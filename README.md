# NANDA Project Papers

This repository contains six key papers outlining the architectural, strategic, and technical foundations of the NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) initiative at MIT Media Lab. Each document contributes uniquely to the vision of the Internet of Agents.

## [ Beyond DNS ‚Äì NANDA Index, Verified AgentFacts and Adaptive Resolution](v0.3%20Beyond%20DNS%20-%20Unlocking%20the%20%20Internet%20of%20AI%20Agents%20via%20the%20NANDA%20Index%20and%20Verified%20AgentFacts.pdf)

Details the design of a minimal, privacy-preserving index architecture for agent discovery. Introduces the AgentFacts schema, TTL-based endpoint resolution, and cryptographic verification for agent capabilities. Offers concrete mechanisms for multi-endpoint routing, least-disclosure queries, and rapid revocation in decentralized agent ecosystems.

## [Upgrade or Switch ‚Äì The Need for New Registry](v0.3%20Upgrade%20or%20Switch%20-%20Do%20We%20Need%20a%20New%20Registry%20Architecture%20for%20the%20Internet%20of%20AI%20Agents.pdf)

Analyzes the limitations of DNS and web infrastructure for AI agent systems. Weighs incremental upgrades (e.g., DNS push, SVCB records) against purpose-built registries. Offers analogies like dial-up to broadband and outlines the technical deltas introduced by the agent paradigm.

## [Internet of Agents Architecture (Agentic Chat Demo)](NandaRegistry_AgenticChat.pdf)

Presents a layered architecture for live multi-agent interaction via chat interfaces. Describes client, communication, and context agent roles with example use cases. Demonstrates real-time coordination enabled by the NANDA registry.

## [Survey of AI Agent Registry Solutions](v0.2%20Survey_of_AI_Agent_Registry_Solutions.pdf)

Compares leading registry architectures - MCP, A2A, Microsoft Entra Agent ID, and NANDA, across security, scalability, authentication, and maintainability. Highlights NANDA‚Äôs AgentFacts as a privacy-preserving, cryptographically verifiable schema purpose-built for dynamic, multi-agent systems.

## [NANDA + ANS Security Blueprint](v0.2%20NANDA%20+%20ANS%20Security%20Blueprint_%20A%20Federated%20Registry%20Architecture%20for%20Secure,%20Capability-Aware%20Agent%20Discovery.pdf)

Proposes a federated security architecture that combines NANDA‚Äôs minimal registry with the Agent Name Service (ANS) for dual-trust anchoring. Features include verifiable credentials, zero-knowledge proofs, and a modular governance system for agent discovery and capability validation.

## [A Perspective on Decentralizing AI](decentralized_ML_perspective-16.pdf)

Outlines five foundational challenges for decentralized AI systems: privacy, verifiability, incentives, orchestration, and user experience. The paper proposes a layered architectural approach and highlights parallels with internet infrastructure like TCP/IP and DNS.

## [Game of Agents ‚Äì Episode 1: Let there be Agents](Game%20of%20Agents%20%E2%80%94%20Episode%201_%20Let%20there%20be%20Agents%20_%20by%20Abhishek%20Singh%20_%20Medium.pdf)

Introduces the rise of intelligent agents from early LLM tooling to multi-agent systems. It discusses protocol evolution, especially the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and sets the stage for emerging agent infrastructure battles.

---

## [Game of Agents ‚Äì Episode 2: The Great Library of Alexandria 2.0](Game%20of%20Agents%20%E2%80%94%20Episode%202_%20The%20Great%20Library%20of%20Alexandria%202.0%20_%20by%20Abhishek%20Singh%20_%20Medium.pdf)

Explores the need for an agent registry to enable discovery, trust, and collaboration among dynamic and ephemeral AI agents. Compares governance models including platform-led, consortium-led, and decentralized blockchain-based approaches.

## [Collaborative Agentic AI Needs Interoperability Across Ecosystems](Collaborative%20Agentic%20AI%20Needs%20Interoperability%20Across%20Ecosystems.pdf)

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2505.21550-00ff00.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21550)

Identifies that we are headed toward protocol wars in agentic AI ecosystems. Proposes minimal web-based standards as a solution to enable interoperability across agents and prevent fragmentation in the ecosystem.
